# UWpath
Brief Description
This app enables users to find the shortest path (shortest walking time) between two buildings
on the UW campus. The app makes use of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the
connections in a graph that contains buildings on (and close to) campus as the notes, and
walking paths between neighboring buildings as edges. The data is loaded from a local file that
the user specifies.
